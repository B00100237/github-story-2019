        <p>
            It’s the middle of April and it’s the hottest month of the new year so far and all the kids were in their shorts and skirts and light school uniform.
            Each morning the family would walk to the girl’s school with their dog and then walk back home.
            For what started out to be a good, happy Spring day, it was about to get darker and sadder.

        </p>

        <p>
            The girl’s parents were keeping a secret from their two girls for a reason.
            The dog they only got a few months ago had fallen very ill and they knew the dog didn’t have long left to live but couldn’t bring themselves to tell the two girls.
            So, while the two girls were at school, they brought the dog to the vet to get it put down so it wasn’t in anymore pain,
            it was a very tough decision but they felt it was best for the girls sakes.

        </p>

        <p>
            It’s 3.00pm and the sun is still shining high and bringing a lot of heat.
            The girls walked back home with their friends that lived right beside them.
            As soon as they got home they noticed that Quincy was no longer in the house,
            they quickly ran to their parents and asked where he was and the two heart broken parents couldn’t bring themselves to say what really happened, they simply responded with,
            “His mom came home for him and took him home”, the two girls while being very upset only responded with “At least he’s with his mom now”
            The parents made a deal between them that once the girls got older they would explain to them what really happened but until then, they need not know.
        </p>
