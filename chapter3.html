        <p>
            It’s the middle of April and it’s the hottest month of the new year so far and all the kids were in the shorts and skirts and light school uniform.
            Each morning the family would walk to the girl’s school with their dog and then walk back home.
            For what started out to be a good, happy Spring day, it was about to get darker and sadder.

        </p>

        <p>
            The girl’s parents were keeping a secret from their two girls for a reason.
            The dog they only got a few months ago had fallen very ill and they knew the dog didn’t have long left to live but couldn’t bring themselves to tell the two girls.
            So, while the two girls were at school, they brought the dog to the vet to get it put down so it wasn’t in anymore pain,
            it was a very tough decision but they felt it was best for the girls sakes.

        </p>
