        <p>
            It’s the middle of April and it’s the hottest month of the new year so far and all the kids were in the shorts and skirts and light school uniform.
            Each morning the family would walk to the girl’s school with their dog and then walk back home.
            For what started out to be a good, happy Spring day and got better throughout the day.
        </p>

        <p>
            After dropping the girls off to school, the parents took Quincy to the park and let him play with other dogs.
            When they were finished at the park, they returned home and got out the kids’ pool and had ice -cream ready for the two girls when they get home which is any time now.

        </p>

        <p>
            The minute the door-bell rang, Quincy ran straight for the door to meet the two girls. Once the two girls got changed,
            they went into the swimming pool and were joined by Quincy who loved to swim and had their ice-creams while enjoying the Spring weather.
