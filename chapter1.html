        <p>
            In a small town in Belarus there were two orphans that loved the constant snow and building snowmen.
            The one thing they longed for was a family and wished for nothing more.
            One a rather warm day the two orphans were inside playing with there toys when suddenly they were approached by one of the workers there and said there are people who would like to meet you.
            Little did they know it was their wish coming true.

        </p>

        <p>After long hours of being in court and signing documents the two orphans finally had a family, they could call their own.
        There new home was in Ireland, a place where itâ€™s usually always raining. Today however the sun was splitting the stones and the two girls were very happy with their new mom and dad.
        As soon as the plane landed, they all headed home from the airport to meet their new home and other family members.
