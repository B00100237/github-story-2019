        <p>
            A few months after the two girls had settled in, the parents felt their kids were missing something,
            so one day while the girls were at school,
            the parents took a trip to visit a fried they knew whose dog had puppies a few weeks back and wanted to buy one off them for their little girls.
            They were able to get the last dog that was there and brought it home with them.

        </p>

        <p>When school was finished that day, the two girls arrived home to find a small little Yorkshire Terrier running around the kitchen.
            The parents left it up to the girls to name the dog and the girls being such huge fans of the cartoon shoe Mary Kate and Ashley,
            they called their dog after the dog in the show, Quincy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Quincy was loved by the two girls and was spoiled rotten by all in the family.
            It was Spring in Ireland so the girls would always bring Quincy out for a walk and let him play in the fields and go for a swim in the river.
            Quincy really enjoyed the hot weather and even had some ice-cream to cool himself down.
            All around the neighbourhood were people sun-bathing and having water balloon fights,
            everyone was making the best of the rare good weather in Ireland.
